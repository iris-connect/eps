# Welcome!

The **Endpoint System (EPS)** provides several server and client components that manage and secure the communication in the IRIS ecosystem. Notably, the EPS provides two core components:

* A **message broker / mesh router** services that transmits requests between different actors in the system and ensures mutual authorization and authentication.
* A **distributed service directory** that stores cryptographically signed information about actors in the system, and is used by the message broker for authentication, service discovery and connection establishment.

In addition it provides a **TLS passthrough proxy service** that enables direct, end-to-end encrypted communication between client endpoints and health departments.
